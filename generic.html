										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<p>Nice to meet you! My name is Christina Gao, a passionate and results-driven technology enthusiast with a keen interest in data analysis and management. Throughout my academic journey at the 
										University of California Santa Cruz, where I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Technology Information & Management with a Minor in Economics, I've developed a solid foundation in data analysis, 
										database management, and business strategy.</p>
									<p>Driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving, I enjoy diving into complex datasets, extracting valuable insights, and translating them into actionable recommendations. My hands-on experience with 
										tools such as SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI, combined with my proficiency in data visualization and manipulation techniques, allows me to tackle real-world challenges with confidence and precision.</p>
									<p>What intrigues me the most about data is its power to unlock valuable insights and drive informed decision-making. Data serves as a gateway to understanding the world around us, 
										and it allows us to uncover trends, solve complex problems, and make predictions. The ability to gather, analyze, and interpret data has the potential to transform industries, improve 
										processes, and enhance our understanding of various phenomena.</p>
									<p>Beyond technical skills, I bring a strong sense of adaptability, attention to detail, and a proactive mindset to every project I undertake. Whether it's optimizing workflows, conducting thorough analyses, 
										or providing exceptional customer service, I thrive in dynamic environments where I can make a meaningful impact.
										These values reflect the principles I hold dear and strive to uphold in everything I do. They are the foundation upon which I build my career and relationships.</p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Respect</strong> is at the core of how I engage with others. I recognize the unique strengths and contributions of each team member and foster an environment of mutual respect and collaboration. 
												Whether working independently or in a team setting, I prioritize open communication, trust, and cooperation.</li>
											<li><strong>Passion</strong> fuels my drive to excel in every endeavor. I'm deeply passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and drive positive change. Whether it's diving into data analysis projects, 
												exploring new technologies, or contributing to community initiatives, I approach each opportunity with enthusiasm and a genuine desire to make a difference.</li>
											<li><strong>Communication</strong> is key to building strong relationships and driving successful outcomes. I place a high value on clear and transparent communication, whether it's conveying complex technical concepts
												to non-technical stakeholders or collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams. I believe in fostering an environment where ideas are freely exchanged, feedback is welcomed, and solutions are co-created.</li>
											<li><strong>Empathy</strong> guides my interactions with colleagues and clients alike. I believe in understanding perspectives, listening actively, and approaching challenges with compassion. By putting myself in others' 
												shoes, I strive to create inclusive environments where everyone feels heard and valued.</li>
