            <p>My name is Christina Gao and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I attended the University of California at Santa Cruz (2019-2023) and obtained a Bachelors of Science 
            in Technology Information Management and a Minor in Economics.</p>
            <p><br>I developed an interest in data analysis when I was introduced to SQL during one of my undergraduate courses, specifically, CSE182: Introduction to Database Management Systems.</p>
            <p><br>After graduating in the summer of 2023, I embarked on a journey to dive deeper into the realm of data analytics through online courses and research.</p>
            <p><br>What intrigues me the most about data is its power to unlock valuable insights and drive informed decision-making. Data serves as a gateway to understanding the world around us, 
                and it allows us to uncover trends, solve complex problems, and make predictions. The ability to gather, analyze, and interpret data has the potential to transform industries, improve 
                processes, and enhance our understanding of various phenomena. It's a dynamic and ever-evolving field that continues to push the boundaries of what's possible, and I find that aspect incredibly captivating.</p>
